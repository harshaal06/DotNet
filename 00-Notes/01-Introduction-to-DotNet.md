# Introduction to .NET

## What is .NET?

.NET is a free, cross-platform, open-source developer platform for building many different types of applications.

## .NET Versions

### .NET Framework
- Windows-only
- Mature and stable
- Used for legacy applications

### .NET Core
- Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- Open-source
- High performance
- Modern architecture

### .NET (Current)
- Unified platform (formerly .NET 5+)
- Successor to .NET Core
- Latest version: .NET 8
- Recommended for new projects

## Key Components

### Common Language Runtime (CLR)
- Manages execution of .NET programs
- Provides memory management, garbage collection
- Handles security and exception handling

### Base Class Library (BCL)
- Collection of reusable classes and types
- Provides common functionality
- Examples: Collections, File I/O, Networking

### Languages
- **C#** - Primary language (most popular)
- **F#** - Functional programming
- **VB.NET** - Visual Basic

## Why .NET?

✅ **Cross-platform** - Run on Windows, Linux, macOS
✅ **High Performance** - Optimized for speed
✅ **Open Source** - Community-driven
✅ **Modern** - Regular updates and improvements
✅ **Versatile** - Web, Desktop, Mobile, Cloud, IoT
✅ **Strong Ecosystem** - Rich libraries and tools

## Application Types

- **Web Applications** - ASP.NET Core MVC, Blazor
- **Web APIs** - RESTful services
- **Desktop Apps** - WPF, WinForms, MAUI
- **Mobile Apps** - .NET MAUI
- **Microservices** - Cloud-native applications
- **Console Apps** - Command-line tools

## Getting Started

1. Install .NET SDK from [dotnet.microsoft.com](https://dotnet.microsoft.com)
2. Verify installation: `dotnet --version`
3. Create your first project: `dotnet new console`
4. Run: `dotnet run`

## Key Concepts

- **Managed Code** - Code executed by CLR
- **Garbage Collection** - Automatic memory management
- **Type Safety** - Compile-time and runtime type checking
- **Interoperability** - Can work with other languages/platforms
